## Project Portfolio 3- Python Essentials - Code Institute.

## Budget App

The project will cover creating a budget manager.
Its aim is to add a user, let them enter there income either by week, month or year. I will break down there income by week, month or year.
After the user should be able to enter there budget,for this we will ask them to enter there budget name and the amount by month and we will work out there weekly and yearly costs. How much they want to spend and what they actually spent, and add it back to there income or minus it from that income.
Then we can ask the user if they want to invest the remaining amount or a percentage of the remaining amount.
For the investment we will also explain how long that invested amount will take to become 1,000,000 with interest from the initial investment.

## User Experience

* As a user I want to be able to find out my income through out the year
* I want the user to know there fortnight, monthly and yearly incomes
* I want to be able to create budgets and find out what the spendings are
* I want to be able to display the information as it helps users to see rather then have it in the back ground
* After I want to help get the idea to invest by using simple interest.
*  I want it to be a simple app for a User
  
## Site Aims:
* I wanted to learn Python and show my logic with a budget, app as we are experiencing higher inflation in Europe.
* I want to show the importance of saving and budgeting
* I want to show the importance of investing 

## How Is This Will Be Achieved:
* By using Github, Python and heroku.

Welcome 

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
